_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Depicts wavelet coefficients according to time and resolution
     level.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     multires(wcUntrimmed, lowest = 3, coarse = 3, highestplot = NULL, descending = FALSE, sc = 1)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

wcUntrimmed: Vector of wavelet coefficients; must be of dyadic length.

  lowest: Lowest resolution level.

  coarse: Coarse resolution level; same as lowest.

highestplot: Highest resolution level.

descending: logical indicating whether resolutions are depicted with
          highest at the top of the plot (FALSE, the default), or at
          the bottom (TRUE).

      sc: graphical scaling parameter of heights of lines representing
          wavelet coefficients; default is 1.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     Depicts wavelet coefficients according to time (horizontal axis)
     and resolution level lowest, lowest+1,...,highestplot.
